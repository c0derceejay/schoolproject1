        <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Chris Jackson. I am 30 years old and a Freelance Web Developer pursuing my Bachelors
            degree in Information Technology. I am a Father to a 2 year old daughter and she is my world, always keeping
            me on my toes and in tune with the latest Disney movie or character. I have been serving Active Duty in the
            US Army for the past 11 years now, and have decided to pursue my dreams as a Developer after my current
            contract ends. For now I have been spending my time learning as much as I can about Web Development and more
            so Python programming. My web development experience comes from the last 2 years of completing online
            bootcamps and following along Youtube tutorials and I have built a solid foundation with those resources.

            see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. - Stephen Hawking"</h4>
        <p>
            I am very excited to be apart of this course with a focus on Web Development because I feel that this is a
            great opportunity to learn a skill that can be used for life, creating freelance opportunity and consistent
            income as long as you are willing to learn the most up to date design principles and tricks to stand out
            amongst the competition! In todays world, having a website to showcase what it is that you do or what your
            business is for, is very important. This will allow users all over the world to get direct access to your
            information and services whether at home on a computer or while youre traveling with a mobile phone or
            tablet.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe having a solid portfolio is required as a Web Developer who wishes to seek potential clients. If
            you have no work to showcase so that people can see your skills and what you are capable of doing, then
            finding work will be even harder. With online resources like Github Pages or even Wordpress, it has become
            alot easier for developers to showcase there work without having to put up alot of money to publish it. Of
            course if you wish to look more professional and have a custom domain, then having a website publish through
            a hosting service with a paid domain is definitely the route to go.

        <h2><u>Career Goals</u></h2>
        <p>
            Ever since I first left the US Marine Corps back in 2013, I have been working around people in Information Technology fields. Our "Human Resources" office in fact was right next door, and I made many friends with people in the field. I began doing research on my own, learning about computers and how they work and started messing around with them. I have made it my duty to learn as much as I can on my own through Youtube, online courses, and documentation provided by the community. The end goal for me is to be a full stack developer who is capable of starting an application from scratch and launching it for people to use around the world. <u>Below I have roadmapped some of the steps that I am looking to accomplish before 2022 :</u>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete my portfolio with full responsiveness and showcase projects that I can present to a potential employer or partner.</li>
            <li>Start to learn a library such as Vue or React JS.</li>
            <li>Complete my degree in Information Technology.</li>
        </ul>
